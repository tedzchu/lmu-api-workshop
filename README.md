# API Calls in Client-Side JavaScript

## Introduction

This will be an introductory workshop on retrieving data using the `fetch()` API for GET requests with Promises. Maybe I'll have time for more, but only tell.

This material is just a compilation of the API Calls workshop I am leading at Loyola Marymount University's inaugural hackathon (LMU Hacks). I wouldn't call myself a know-it-all and some of this material is highly tailored to the material I will be presenting on, but I'll do my best to document here.
